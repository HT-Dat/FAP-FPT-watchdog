# FAP FPT University Watchdog
## Introduction
This is a small tool I make to alert me when FAP allows for switching classes. It can be used to track other things as well since it just an image tracker
## Background
My university allows for switching classes at the end of every semester. Unfortunately, good teachers only teach in a small amount of class. For me to able to switch to their class, I need to be fast or other students will take all of the slots. So I made this tool, alert me when school allows for switch class so that I can switch class fast while not having to check every time.
## How does this works?
The program will capture the screen as fast as possible.
noCourse.png is the input image for the program. If it cannot found on the screen, It's mean the website has changed and it will play the alert.mp3.
Although the okaysound.mp3 is unused. I have a plan to program it so it will play every 2 minutes so that I can make sure the program is working probably while doing other things.
